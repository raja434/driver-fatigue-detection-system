# step 1:
 install all libraries
 - scipy  (pip install scipy)
     - We’ll need the SciPy package so we can compute the Euclidean distance between facial landmarks points in the eye aspect ratio calculation (not strictly a requirement, but you should have SciPy installed if you intend on doing any work in the computer vision, image processing, or machine learning space).

- OpenCv (pip install opencv-python)
  - openCv for computer vision

- numpy (pip install numpy)
  - numpy for basic processing and calcutions ...

- imutils (pip install imutils)
   - We’ll also need the imutils package, my series of computer vision and image processing functions to make working with OpenCV easier.

-  pyglet (pip install pyglet) or playsound (pip install playsound)
    - we'll also need pyglet/playsound  playing sound such as .mp3 , .wav ...  


-  dlib
   - To detect and localize facial landmarks we’ll need the dlib library


# installation of Dlib libary 
These instructions assume you are on macOS, but basically the same on Linux.

Pre-reqs:
- Have Python 3 installed. On macOS, this could be installed from homebrew or even via standard 
  Python 3.6 downloaded installer from https://www.python.org/download. On Linux, just use your
  package manager.
- On macOS:
  - Install XCode from the Mac App Store (or install the XCode command line utils).
  - Have [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed
  - Install boost with this command: `brew install boost-python --with-python3 --without-python`
- On Linux:
  - Install boost. On Ubuntu, that's `sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev`
- This assumes you don't have an nVidia GPU and don't have Cuda and cuDNN installed and don't want
  GPU acceleration (since none of the current Mac models support this).

Clone the code from github:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davisking/dlib.git
```

Build the main dlib library:

```bash
cd dlib
mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DDLIB_USE_CUDA=0 -DUSE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS=1; cmake --build .
```

Build and install the Python extensions:

```bash
cd ..
python3 setup.py install --yes USE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS --no DLIB_USE_CUDA
```

At this point, you should be able to run `python3` and type `import dlib` successfully.

# if you have python 2.7.---
```bash
cd ..
python setup.py install --yes USE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS --no DLIB_USE_CUDA
```
# step 2
- Download the dlib’s pre-trained facial landmark detector. from hear "http://jmp.sh/4bIYiPU " place it place it same floder where alarm.wav contains 

- Note: without dlib’s pre-trained facial landmark detector file you can't run the code 

# step 3

```bash
python drowsiness detection.py

```
